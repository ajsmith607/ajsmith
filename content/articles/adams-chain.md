Determining the length of the chain involves not only knowing the link length from one outside edge to the other, but must account for overlapping links, and the fact that all links overlap on both sides, except for the end links. 

The complete formula for determining the length of a chain is:

```
CL = (LN*LL) - ((LT*2) * (LN-1))

```

where:

  - CL = total chain length
  - LN = total number of links in the chain 
  - LL = the length of each link
  - LT = the thickness of each link
