In the past year, I have been creating a number of Hugo sites and modules and have been enjoying the convenience of hosting on Github pages. I routinely run the *script* command to capture my terminal sessions to later document my processes for future re-use, and if possible, to do so in executable code. I have never regretted this investment of time.

The following is my current such documentation, in bash code, for creating a new Hugo site hosted on Github pages. Obviously, you will need to change the USERNAME variable accordingly.
