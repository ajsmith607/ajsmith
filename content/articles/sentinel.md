Following the discovery of several hundred newspapers from the 1930's from the Town of Woodhull New York, a plan was developed to digitize and preserve the content. In April 2025, the Town of Woodhull reviewed the project proposal and agreed to fund it. The project will begin Summer 2025 with the vendor [Backstage Library Works](http://www.bslw.com), with a goal of completion by the end of 2025.
