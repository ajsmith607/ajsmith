Following the discovery of several hundred newspapers from the 1930's from the Town of Woodhull New York, a plan was developed to digitize and preserve the content. In April 2025, the Town of Woodhull reviewed the project proposal and agreed to fund it. The project will begin Summer 2025 with the vendor [Backstage Library Works](http://www.bslw.com), with a goal of completion by the end of 2025.

## July 24, 2025 Update

On July 24, 2025, Leslie and Adam Smith delivered 394 newspaper issues to Backstage Library Works in Bethlehem PA for digitization and archival storage, and our project manager gave us a tour of the facility that included their content storage area as well as employees actively photographing and reviewing digital files for other newspaper digitization projects in progress. 

Our project manager said that they would likely do an initial assessment of the collection in August and that they expect the digitization to be completed by the end of the year. She also offered to give us a few initial digitized images once work begins so we can review their work early in the process. 

When the work is complete, Leslie and Adam will retrieve both the original print materials and the digital files to return them to the Town of Woodhull, and Adam will re-inventory the physical materials and begin our own quality control checks and packaging of the digital files for distribution in the first quarter 2026.

Leslie and Adam also discussed options for making the files available on a Town of Woodhull website, and these discussions will continue.

Since the original project proposal, Leslie discovered 22 more newspaper issues that have been included in the collection, and we have asked Backstage to give us an updated cost estimate after their August review. (Increased costs include not only additional digitization effort, but possibly more archival storage boxes.)

Additionally, we discovered one issue was printed with an incorrect date, and there are a total of 10 issues that are duplicated, that we intentionally included in case the paired issues can clarify each other. I have alerted both Backstage and New York State Historic Newspapers to these points.
