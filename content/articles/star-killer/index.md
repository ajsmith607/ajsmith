The Brookton Star Killer was a postal stamp cancelling mark used from 28 Jul 1885 to 12 May 1889 during the appointment of Postmaster Edward Hallock Mills in the hamlet of Brookton (now Brooktondale), Town of Caroline, Tompkins County New York. This article explores the design of the Star Killer, and a recreation is attempted and documented.

> A postmark is a postal marking made on an envelope, parcel, postcard or the like, indicating the place, date and time that the item was delivered into the care of a postal service, or sometimes indicating where and when received or in transit. Modern postmarks are often applied simultaneously with **the cancellation or killer** that marks postage stamps as having been used. Sometimes a postmark alone is used to cancel stamps, and the two terms are often used interchangeably.
