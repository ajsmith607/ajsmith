Brookton Berryard (Planning.)
Logo concept for naturally fermented herbaceous wine, produced from local, organically grown blackberries. My original concept and design.
Deedmapify (In progress.)
Deedmapify allows anyone to easily create and analyze accurate survey maps based on legal deed descriptions. My original concept, code, design and copy.
pip Imagined logo for a minimal, functional chess piece set concept I created that resembles the faces of dice, called pip.</description></item><item><title>Contact</title><link>https://ajsmith.co/contact/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ajsmith.co/contact/</guid><description> Submit</description></item><item><title>Pip: Minimal Two-Dimensional Chess Piece Set</title><link>https://ajsmith.co/articles/minimal-chess-pieces/</link><pubDate>Fri, 02 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ajsmith.co/articles/minimal-chess-pieces/</guid><description>&lt;p>This article explores a concept for minimal, two-dimensional chess pieces for use in digital environments. I wanted to create a &lt;em>functional&lt;/em> approach, in which the design of each piece represents its capabilities instead of its name. Similar in appearance to the faces of dice, the arrangement of pips reflects each piece&amp;rsquo;s legal movement pattern.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Wine Cube: simple wine bottle storage model</title><link>https://ajsmith.co/articles/wine-cube/</link><pubDate>Mon, 29 Jul 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ajsmith.co/articles/wine-cube/</guid><description>&lt;p>Wine Cube is a simple, configurable OpenSCAD based system for creating passive, minimal, modular, high density wine bottle storage shelving units. Configuration options include simple ways of changing the dimensions, capacity and bottle orientation of each shelving unit. This project grew out of a personal need for such shelving and a desire to learn CAD. It is an ongoing, open source project that I am releasing early as I have judged it to have reached a stage of being minimally interesting. This project may be useful to someone looking for a very simple, inexpensive and utilitarian approach to wine bottle shelving, in their home, in a location where its stark appearance won&amp;rsquo;t offend, such as a basement or garage area. Its simplicity may also make it a good example project for learning OpenSCAD, as I have tried to keep the code simple, clear and logically organized. This article provides a brief description of Wine Cube, my motivation for creating it, and my reasons for choosing OpenSCAD.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>cell: minimal geometric font</title><link>https://ajsmith.co/articles/cell/</link><pubDate>Wed, 24 Jul 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ajsmith.co/articles/cell/</guid><description>&lt;p>Cell is a minimal, geometric, sans-serif, monospace, all caps display font.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Streamlining Static Web Development</title><link>https://ajsmith.co/articles/static-development-streamlining/</link><pubDate>Wed, 24 Jul 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ajsmith.co/articles/static-development-streamlining/</guid><description>&lt;p>There are times when even using Hugo for static web development is overkill. This articles shows how to efficiently develop small static web pages with some of the same advantages as the Hugo environment:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Easily invoke a zero-configured static web server.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Optimize development efficiency with LiveReload.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Automate the environment.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Optimize for production.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>The solutions described will use &lt;a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">Node.js&lt;/a> and Bash scripts.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>comparing facial symmetry between photographs</title><link>https://ajsmith.co/articles/comparing-facial-symmetry/</link><pubDate>Tue, 14 Feb 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ajsmith.co/articles/comparing-facial-symmetry/</guid><description>&lt;p>In recent research, I received two photographs of unidentified women that were purported family members, and I wanted to explore a structured way of comparing them that could also be easily communicated as a two-dimensional still image for ease of publication/distribution. The following is the approach I took, and although I don&amp;rsquo;t know if this approach is valid, I thought the process and the results were interesting enough to warrant this description.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>spatially mapping derivative content to original documents</title><link>https://ajsmith.co/articles/quaddress-intro/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Jun 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ajsmith.co/articles/quaddress-intro/</guid><description>&lt;p>Quadrant Addressing or &lt;em>Quaddressing&lt;/em> provides an intuitive and consistent way to make relative spatial references to an original, two dimensional artifact (primarily for documents such as a printed text, photographs, etc.) regardless of its size or shape, or whether the artifact is physical or digital. Quaddressing relies on imprecision to aid human judgement instead of relying on highly precise measurements of varying units across different types of documents, thereby greatly increasing the ease and efficiency of both recording and interpretation across all documents for both human actors and code.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>my process for creating new Hugo sites</title><link>https://ajsmith.co/articles/hugo-github-pages-workflow/</link><pubDate>Sun, 01 May 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ajsmith.co/articles/hugo-github-pages-workflow/</guid><description>My current documentation, in bash code, for creating a new Hugo site hosted on Github pages.</description></item><item><title>Thank You</title><link>https://ajsmith.co/thankyou/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ajsmith.co/thankyou/</guid><description>Thank you for your message!</description></item></channel></rss>
