<time datetime="Monday 04 Sep 2023" class=text-muted>Monday 04 Sep 2023</time></div><div class=content><p>In recent research, I received two photographs of unidentified women that were purported family members, and I wanted to explore a structured way of comparing them that could also be easily communicated as a two-dimensional still image for ease of publication/distribution. The following is the approach I took, and although I don&rsquo;t know if this approach is valid, I thought the process and the results were interesting enough to warrant this description.</p><p>The one advantage I had was that the women in the two photographs were posed very similarly, and as I came to realize, the orientation of their heads is almost exactly identical. I wanted to see which facial features would align vertically and horizontally (or not) and so, I put them side-to-side and top-to-bottom in a visual matrix to compare both dimensions in one image. To properly align the photographs initially, I decided to use their eyes, as that doubled the initial reference points between the two photos, and further facilitated this visual matrix approach.</p><p>I began by cropping the faces of the subjects closer, and placed one on top of the other. I drew two vertical lines through the upper subject&rsquo;s pupils, then resized the lower subject&rsquo;s face until her pupil&rsquo;s aligned.</p><figure class=image><img src=/articles/images/comparing-facial-symmetry/1.png width=500></figure><p>Already, some useful comparisons can be made.</p><p>I then copied the lower subject to the right of the upper left subject to horizontally align the eyes.</p><figure class=image><img src=/articles/images/comparing-facial-symmetry/2.png width=500></figure><p>I then copied the upper left subject to the lower right quadrant to fully enable the comparisons I wanted to explore. I then added parallel vertical and horizontal lines to see if other features aligned as well.</p><figure class=image><img src=/articles/images/comparing-facial-symmetry/final.png width=500></figure><p>In this case, the similarities were very consistent.</p></div><nav class=tags><ul><li><a href=/tags/historical-research>historical-research</a></li></ul></nav></article></main><aside><div><div><h3>LATEST POSTS</h3></div><div><ul><li><a href=/articles/comparing-facial-symmetry/>comparing facial symmetry between photographs</a></li><li><a href=/articles/quaddress-intro/>spatially mapping derivative content to original documents</a></li><li><a href=/articles/hugo-github-pages-workflow/>my process for creating new Hugo sites</a></li></ul></div></div></aside><footer><p clas=copyright>&copy; <span id=cwyear></span> <a href=https://ajsmith.co/>a j smith</a></p><script>document.getElementById("cwyear").innerHTML=(new Date).getFullYear()</script></footer></body></html>
