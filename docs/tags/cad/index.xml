Configuration options include simple ways of changing the dimensions, capacity and bottle orientation of each shelving unit. This project grew out of a personal need for such shelving and a desire to learn CAD. It is an ongoing, open source project that I am releasing early as I have judged it to have reached a stage of being minimally interesting. This project may be useful to someone looking for a very simple, inexpensive and utilitarian approach to wine bottle shelving, in their home, in a location where its stark appearance won&amp;rsquo;t offend, such as a basement or garage area. Its simplicity may also make it a good example project for learning OpenSCAD, as I have tried to keep the code simple, clear and logically organized. This article provides a brief description of Wine Cube, my motivation for creating it, and my reasons for choosing OpenSCAD.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
